# MarkItDown

MarkItDown is a command-line interface tool that allows users to easily generate a professional README file for their GitHub projects. With this tool, users can quickly input information about their project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, contribution guidelines, and test instructions.

The tool uses Node.js packages like Inquirer and fs to prompt the user for information and write the markdown string to a README.md file. It also includes input validation functions to ensure that the user's input is valid, such as validating the user's GitHub username and email address.
